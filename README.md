solo project for pokemonapi

wanted to add a lot of functionality but ran out of health

-was working on a full pokedex, couldnt get syntax working to pull everything correctly without over whelming the page.
-wanted to make a 3d carousel i searched far and wide, but most still use jquery or some other library- def on my to do lsit
-also want to add pokemon evolutions

many things to add, def would love to work on it and enhance it further.
